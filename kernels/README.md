# Custom Compiled from OrangePI Build Framework
THese `.debs` can be installed as I have included multiple missing features. In the default kernel x2 important features (filesystem support) are missing

1- `cifs` support; you cannot mount a samba shared directory
2- `nfs` support is added 
THese kernerls can be used with official `jammy` image v1.0.4
